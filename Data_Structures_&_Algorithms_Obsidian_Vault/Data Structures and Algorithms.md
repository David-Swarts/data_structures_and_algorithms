Big Ideas: 
Data Structures are ultimately ways to organize data. All data is in memory which is it's self a giant array, but if we just treat it like an array, we might not get the benefits of adding additional constraints. - All Data Structures are built off of the top of arrays

-Algorithms are just step by step procedures to accomplish a goal. They can be measured by how many additional "atomic procedures" are added to the total number when you add another element to be processed. This is where the ideas of big O notation come from.

-Data Structures and Algorithms are the fundamental
